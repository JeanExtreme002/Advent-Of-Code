# Advent-of-Code
This repository contains the solutions I created for the Advent of Code challenges in Python.

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill <br>
levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, <br>
interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. <br><br>
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge <br> 
and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every <br>
problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
